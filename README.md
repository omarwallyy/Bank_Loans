# Bank_Loans
# Objective: 
### Make a model that would predict given a customer data applying for a loan whether he would be able to pay the loan back or not
# Steps:
## 1) Data Exploration:
#### I explored the data to understand it more, how is the data distributed, what could be the reasons behind missing values and how to clean them.
## 2) Data Cleaning:
#### I checked the features with missing values and analyzed them to see the best way to fill them or whether they should be dropped.
## 3) Data Preparation:
#### I converted the features to suitable data types that could be accepted in the machine learning model, then i decided which features should be dropped and which to use in the model.
## 4) Models
#### I splitted my data into train and test, and normalized my features as some models works better when data is normalized, then i applied several models to see which machine learning algorithm works the best on my data.
